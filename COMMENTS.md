## Bug I encountered

When I started the development server for the first time, the network request for fetching all applications failed, and I couldn't determine the cause.

I tried to fix it by delaying the network request for 500ms when, but this solution caused other problems. Unfortunately, I could not debug these issues due to time constraints, so I left the network request as it was.
